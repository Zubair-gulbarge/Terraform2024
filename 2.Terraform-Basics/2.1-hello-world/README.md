This Terraform code defines an output variable named **hello1** with a value of **"Hello World"**. Let's break down the components and their functions:

Components of the Code:
output "hello1": This defines an output variable named hello1. Output variables are used to display information about the resources created or modified by your Terraform configuration.

value = "Hello World": This sets the value of the output variable hello1 to the string "Hello World".

Usage and Purpose:
Define Output Variables: Output variables are useful for extracting information from your Terraform state file, such as resource attributes or computed values. This information can be useful for debugging, passing values to other configurations, or simply displaying information.

Display Values After Apply: After running terraform apply, Terraform will display the values of output variables in the terminal. This helps you verify the outputs of your configuration and retrieve key information without having to manually query the state file.

**Running the Configuration:**
Initialize the Directory:
``terraform init``

Validate the Configuration:
``terraform validate``

Create an Execution Plan:
``terraform plan``

Apply the Configuration:
``terraform apply``
