Components of the JSON Structure:
**Root Object:**
The entire structure is enclosed in curly braces {}, indicating it is a JSON object.

**output Key:**
This key indicates that the following content is related to Terraform outputs. In Terraformâ€™s HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), outputs are typically defined with the output block.

**hello1 Key:**
This key represents the name of the output variable, which is hello1 in this case. In a Terraform HCL configuration, this would correspond to an output "hello1" block.

**value Key:**
This key is nested inside the hello1 output definition and specifies the value assigned to the output variable. The value in this case is the string "This is json format Hello World".

**Example Explanation:**
In HCL format, the equivalent Terraform code for the provided JSON structure would look like this:

HCL Format (first.tf.json):
output "hello1" {
  value = "This is json format Hello World"
}

**Purpose of the JSON Format:**
Terraform configurations are typically written in HCL, but Terraform also supports JSON format. The JSON format is useful for integrating Terraform with other tools and systems that generate or process JSON. This allows for more flexibility in how configurations are defined and manipulated programmatically.

**Running the Configuration:**
If you save the JSON content as **main.tf.json**, Terraform can interpret it and process it similarly to HCL files.

Initialize the Directory:
`terraform init`

Validate the Configuration:
`terraform validate`

Create an Execution Plan:
`terraform plan`

Apply the Configuration:
`terraform apply`

**Output:**
After running `terraform apply`, Terraform will display the output value defined in the JSON:

`Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`
`Outputs:`
`hello1 = This is json format Hello World`

**Summary:**
* **Root Object:** Encapsulates the entire output configuration.
* **output Key:** Indicates the start of an output block.
* **hello1 Key:** Name of the output variable.
* **value Key:** The value assigned to the output variable.

- This JSON format provides a way to define and manage Terraform configurations programmatically, making it easier to integrate with automation tools and workflows that handle JSON.
