# Introduction Terraform

* Introduction to IaC?
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and automation tools, instead of manual processes. It enhances consistency, reduces errors, and enables version control for infrastructure management.

* What is Terraform?
- Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. Terraform supports various cloud providers and services, enabling consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.

* Why Terraform?
- Terraform is preferred for infrastructure management because it offers:
1. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Works with various cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises solutions.
2. **Declarative Syntax**: Users define desired end-state, and Terraform handles the provisioning.
3. **Automation and Consistency**: Automates infrastructure setup, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency.
4. **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations can be versioned and treated like code.
5. **Modularity**: Supports reusable modules for efficient management of complex infrastructure.
6. **State Management**: Keeps track of infrastructure state, allowing incremental changes and management of dependencies.
